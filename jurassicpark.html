	<h2>A time before the world knew about Jurassic World...</h2>

	<p>There was almost an amusement park called Jurassic Park. Just off the coast of Costa Rica, on the same island as Jurassic World, John Hammond founded the park. John Hammond was also the CEO of International Genetic Technologies, Inc. (InGen Inc). Jurassic Park was founded for the sole purpose of making profit and furthering genetic studies. Mr. Hammond payed no mind towards the dangers both his companies, Jurassic Park and InGen, were posing. Hammond showcased little to no interest in the genetic engineering field, he was only interested and driven by the profits these luxuries could have once he started to clone dinosaur DNA. John Hammond had discovered how to clone dinosaurs from blood samples preserved in insects stuck in amber, and he immediately started to see dollar signs. He pushed for the opening of Jurassic Park, but due to insurance reasons, he had to slow down the process because of possible safety hazards. Hammond had invited paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist Ellie Sattler, along with a mathematician named Ian Malcolm who was brought on as an insurance consultant, to the island to get their feedback and approval of the animals and park in general.</p>
