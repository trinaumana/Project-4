	<h2><b>Are they even dinosaurs?</b></h2>
	<p class="indent">InGen Inc originally started to clone dinosaur DNA (which they found inside insects preserved in amber). However, after the Jurassic Park incident, a different company, the Masrani Global Corporation, took over. However, both companies were dealing with the same problem: some of the dinosaur DNA strands had decomposed, because DNA can only last for so long. So, to fill the missing portions, the engineers pull DNA strands from reptiles, amphibians, and more animals we know today. So, we must pose the question: are these even truly dinosaurs anymore? Have these dinosaurs been engineered to look more like the dinosaurs we first imagined them to be? What if they are adding enhancements to make their animals more enticing, to lure us to give Jurassic World money?</p>
	<img src="images/drwu.jpg" class="wu" alt="Dr Wu, chief genetic engineer, standing in front of amber samples in the Jurassic World lab."><p>According to inside sources we have, Jurassic World has been genetically modifying and creating brand new super-dinosaurs that are supposed to "intrige and scare the children who visit the park." Is that truly a safe way to ensure sales stay up? Dr Wu, the chief genetic engineer at both Jurassic Park and World, purposely makes sure to include DNA from different animals to enhance the danger we associate with dinosaurs, and the stereotypical appearance of the dinosaurs we grew up knowing.</p>
	<p>For example, the velociraptors at both parks were based off of the dinosaur <i>Deinonychus</i>. The actual velociraptors weighed only 30 pounds at most and were three feet tall. It would take six or seven adult Velociraptors to equal one average-sized Deinonychus<sub>5</sub>. The velociraptors, along with many of the dinosaurs you see at the park, actually had feathers. However, because the park wants to appeal to the ideals of what the majority of the world grew up with (reptilian-looking dinosaurs), they decided to get rid of the feathers and stick with reptilian DNA strands to amp up the stereotypical dinosaur appearance.</p>
	<h2><b>What does this mean?</b></h2>
	<p class="indent">When you take your children to Jurassic World to learn about dinosaurs, you have to think about the logistics behind it. Jurassic World has created hybrids of animals from two very distinct periods in time. These are not the same dinosaurs that walked the earth 65 million years ago; these animals are living creations that are meant to embody what we have grown to be familiar with as the dinosaur appearance, they aren't meant to teach you about the past.</p>
