	<h2>Are they even dinosaurs?</h2>
	<p>InGen Inc clones dinosaur DNA found inside insects preserved in amber, but some of the DNA strands have decomposed, because DNA can only last for so long. So, to fill the missing portions, the engineers working for InGen and Jurassic World pull DNA strands from reptiles, amphibians, and more animals we know today. So, we must pose the question: are these even truly dinosaurs anymore? Have these dinosaurs been engineered to look more like the dinosaurs we first imagined them to be? What if they are adding enhancements to make their animals more enticing, to lure us to give Jurassic World money?</p>
	<p>According to inside sources we have, Jurassic world has been genetically modifying and creating brand new super-dinosaurs that are supposed to "intrige and scare the children who visit the park." Is that truly a safe way to ensure sales stay up?</p>
