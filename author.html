	<h2><b>Why kill the fun?</b></h2>
	<p class="indent">We have no right to bring back the dead. Not only is there a completely different atmosphere that these animals are unfamiliar with, but these animals are hybrids with animals from today. When we insert DNA of animals we know today, such as tree frogs, fish, and others, that is adding to the dinosaurs strengths, and making them less like dinosaurs. We are giving them evolutionary strengths that they shouldn't have. What are we getting ourselves into when we bring our children to Jurassic World? Horrible danger.</p>
	<h2><b>Our Founder</b></h2>
	<img src="images/alangrant.jpg" alt="Our founder, Alan Grant" class="alan"><p class="indent">Alan Grant is a paleontologist who was invited by John Hammond to the original Jurassic Park. He had originally thought the idea of cloning these prehistoric animals was wrong and off-putting, but Hammond convinced him to join the expedition to the Costa Rican amusement park. After fighting for his life on the island, Grant swore to never let such an amusement park ever exist again.</p>
	<h2><b>Our Mission</b></h2>
	<p class="indent">Today we are being faced with a new park, one much worse than what Hammond had originally envisioned. We want to raise awareness of the dangers families face when they decide to vacation at Jurassic World. We do not want another tragedy happening again.</p>
